The goal is to create a website for tracking food consumption amoung friends.


As of 2/12/2021 the Project is still in the plaing stages. I will be updating the progress as I go about creating the website.

The current plan is to use a MySql database to track the food.
First steps are to create the database and try to populate it with test data.
Once the teest data is populated and working I will be uploading the database to a F1-micro instance on google cloud.
